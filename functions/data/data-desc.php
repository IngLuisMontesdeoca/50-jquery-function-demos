Updates to jQuery 1.4 has seen the <strong>ability to attach data of any type to DOM elements</strong>. This is very useful alternative to storing data in JavaScript Objects or such. There are two versions: $.data() which takes in the element as a parameter; or .data() which can attach directly on matched elements. It is worth noting that $.data() returns a data object to the caller whereas .data() does not. There are also many utility functions such as $.hasData(), $.removeData() that help with data management.
