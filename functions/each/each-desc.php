There are two versions of the each method in jQuery - $.each() uses the jQuery namespace and .each() acts directly upon targeted DOM elements. I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.jquery4u.com/javascript/shorthand-javascript-techniques/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">shorthand techniques</a> and jQuery provides us with a fast alternative to basic JavaScript loops. You can use $.each() and .each() on lots of different things such as DOM Elements, Arrays, Objects, JSON etc. I have <a href="http://www.jquery4u.com/jquery-functions/jquery-each-examples/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">5 more jQuery.each() examples</a> to show you!
