JQuery provides us with the .filter() function which <strong>allows us to reduce a set of matched elements</strong> based on a jQuery selector. This is useful when you want to process a group of elements and then further process specific children elements. The .filter() function can be used in a few different ways. You could simply filter by a class name, function or jQuery object.
