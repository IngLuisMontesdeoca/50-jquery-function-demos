The .delegate() function also provides a way of attaching event handlers to new elements, like was saw in the .live() function demo. You may find that <strong>.delegate() is faster than .live()</strong> because the latter searches the entire document <a href="http://www.jquery4u.com/javascript/jquery-function-namespacing-plain-english/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">namespace</a> for the elements as opposed to a single document context. Also, you can specify a jQuery selector to match mutiple events based on a specified set of root elements.
