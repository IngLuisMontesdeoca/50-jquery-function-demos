Along with .preventDefault() there are other methods which do similar things. The .stopPropagation() function <strong>prevents the event from happening on any ancestor elements</strong>. This can be used if you have an exception to the rule you specified for an container element with child elements. Also note that this function currently does not work with .live() events as it handles events once they have propagated to the top of the document.
