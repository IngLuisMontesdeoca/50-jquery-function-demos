The .live() function is essentially the same as .bind() but it can <strong>capture events on new elements</strong> that didn't exist on the page when it was loaded. For example, if your web page has already loaded and you dynamically insert an image into the page. If we used bind to attach an event when the mouse hovers over the image it would not work. But if we use .live() it will work!
