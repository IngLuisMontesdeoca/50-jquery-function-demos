AJAX requests are subject to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">same origin policy</a></li> which means you can only send requests to the same domain. Fortunately, $.ajax() has a property called JSONP (JSON with padding) allows a page to request data from a server in a different domain. It works by wrapping the target data in a JavaScript callback function. It is also worth knowing that the response is not parsed as JSON and can be any JavaScript expression.
