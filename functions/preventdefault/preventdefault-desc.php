The .preventDefault() function can be applied to <strong>stop any element with a default action from firing</strong>: hyperlinks, keyboard shortcuts, form submit buttons etc. This example is probably the most common use and it stops a hyperlink from going to its destination (href). It's very useful for stopping those default actions and running your custom JavaScript actions instead.
