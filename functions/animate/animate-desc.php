The .animate() function can be used to <strong>animate elements on a web page</strong> with little effort. The animations could take the form of movement or appearance, lets look at some examples. The jQuery UI project extends the .animate() method by allowing some non-numeric styles such as colors to be animated. You can replace settings with duration (in milliseconds) or words: 'slow', 'normal' or 'fast' and the callback is optional (this is the code that runs after the animation finishes).
