You can use the .extend() method to <strong>merges the contents of two or more objects</strong> and store the result in the first object (or a new object). To explain the demo in more detail. We want to add another two forms to our site which already has a functional enquiry form. Instead of copying all the code that processes that form <strong>we can use $.extend() to copy the existing functionality</strong> for our new forms to avoid redundant code. You may have noticed that the target element specified is a blank object. This is a trick you will often see to create a new object of "object1" and extend it with "objectN" (N represents any number of objects). So in the example we want to "copy" the existing functionality of forms.enquiry and simply override the email address.
